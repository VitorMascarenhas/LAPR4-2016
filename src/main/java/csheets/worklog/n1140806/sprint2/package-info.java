/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the work of the team member (1140806) Pedro Costa during week2.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Scrum Master: no</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Area Leader: yes</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h2>1. Notes</h2>
 * <p>This week, besides the stuff produced in this user feature, I'm also have worked in the implementation
 * of CRM01.1 Contact Edition (not finished in first week).
 * This implementation consumes a lot of effort of sprint and refer to the following requirements:
 * </p>
 *   <ul>
 *      <li>Update Contact</li>
 *      <li>Delete Contact</li>
 *      <li>Add Event</li>
 *      <li>Edit Event</li>
 *      <li>Delete Event</li>
 *      <li>General improvements on code
 *      (like new interfaces: "IContact", "IEvent", "ISchedulable" or Factories: ContactFactory, EventFactory )</li>
 *      <li>New tests (about 20 unit tests but with many asserts each one)</li>
 *      <li>Improvements on UI (very poor in the first week)</li>
 *      <li>Improvements on JPA Persistence (Important to note that some code for this system persistence were reused from EAPLI Class. The
 *      persistence system is also prepared to use in other entities or user features.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *

 * <h2>4. Analysis</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Analysis</h3>
 *
 * According to the interpretation of the problem will be necessary the implementation of a new Contact Class. Since we already
 * have an interface called "ICONTACT" this new class should implement it. The Company class to create also have an agenda
 * so needs to implement interface ISchedulable (means all classes with Agenda). With this, a huge part of code produced for
 * Personal Contact Agenda can be reused.
 * In the case of the Personal Contact Class we need to add new optional properties (profession and company) and give support
 * to load list of professions from a XML file. For this requirement we can use Strategy Pattern. For creation of contacts and
 * events we use also the Factory Pattern centering the creation of contacts and events in two factories.
 *
 *
 * <h2>5. Design</h2>
 *
 * <h3>5.1. UC Realization</h3>

 * <div>
 * <h3>Create contact</h3>
 * <p>By mistake two class names are wrong in this SSD. Where we read "ProfessionsManager"
 * we should read "ProfessionsManagerXml" and were we read "IProfessions"Strategy" we should read "IProfessionsOperationRead".</p>
